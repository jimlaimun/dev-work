idea is user adds user via form  calling the rest api

payload looking similar to  .../session
{
    name =>[
        {name:david},
        {name:bob},
        {name:Kat},
        ...
}

response give is either 400 bad request or 200 and 
{
    session:{
        Id: 123
    }
}

then user can perform a get request like  .../user
response being
{
    Participant:{
        name: david
    }
}
